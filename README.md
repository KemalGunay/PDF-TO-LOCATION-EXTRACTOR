## üöÄ Features  

- **PDF Parsing**: Reads text from uploaded PDF files using `PyPDF2`.  
- **NLP Entity Extraction**: Identifies location entities (GPE, LOC) using **spaCy**'s NLP pipeline.  
- **Location Matching**: Validates extracted locations against a world cities dataset.  
- **Geocoding**: Fetches precise latitude and longitude for matched locations using `Geopy`.  
- **Interactive Mapping**: Visualizes the geocoded locations on an interactive map with Streamlit.  
- **Secure API Requests**: Custom SSL handling ensures reliable performance for geocoding.
